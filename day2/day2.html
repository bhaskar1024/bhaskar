<h1>ABOUT</h1>
 <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting devices, networks, and digital information from cyber attacks:These cyber attacksare usually aimed at accessing, 
changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
<h1>What it protects:</h1>
      Cybersecurity protects devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets, as well 
as the services and information stored on them. </p>

<b>Reduce the Attack Surface:</b>

Reducing the attack surface minimizes vulnerabilities,making it harder for attackers to exploit your system.
<p><h1>What are Cyber Attacks?</h1>
Cyber attacks are deliberate attempts to infiltrate, damage, disrupt, or steal information from computer systems, networks, or devices using malicious digital tactics.These attacks are typically carried out by individuals or groups with various motivations, including financial gain, espionage, personal grudges, or ideological beliefs. Common types of cyber attacks include:</br></br>

1. <b>Malware:</b> Short for “malicious software,” malware is a broad term encompassing various harmful programs like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These programs can damage systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. </br>
2. <b>Phishing;</b> This involves sending fraudulent communications, often via email, that appear to come from a reputable source. The goal is to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers.</br>
3. <b>Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:</b> These attacks aim to make a website or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources, disrupting services.</br>
4. <b>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</b> In these attacks, the attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge, often to steal data or eavesdrop.</br>
5. <b>SQL Injection:</b> This occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL (Structured Query Language). The server then reveals information it normally would not.</br>
6. <b>Zero-Day Exploit:</b> This involves the exploitation of a security vulnerability before the vendor has released a patch. These are particularly dangerous because they take advantage of known issues before they’re fixed.</br>
7. <b>Ransomware:</b> A type of malware that encrypts the victim’s data, with the attacker demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access.</br>
8. <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</b> In an XSS attack, attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites. When users visit these sites, the scripts can execute and steal information or infect the user’s system.</br>
9. <b>Credential Stuffing:</b> This involves using stolen account credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts through large-scale automated login requests.</br>
10. <b>Insider Threats:</b> Sometimes, the threat comes from within an organization, where an employee or associate with malicious intent exploits their access to harm the organization.</p>
<h1>Types of Cybersecurity</h1>
Cybersecurity has evolved into several specialised areas to address diverse threats. Let's break down the main types:</br>
1. <b>Network Security:</b> Protects communication paths between computers. Uses firewalls and encryption to secure data travelling across networks.</br>
2. <b>Application Security:</b> Focuses on securing software and devices. Involves regular updates and secure coding practices to protect against vulnerabilities.</br>
3. <b>Cloud Security:</b> Protects data stored online from theft, leakage, and deletion. This is essential as more businesses and individuals use cloud storage.</br>
4. <b>Information Security:</b> Protects data integrity and privacy, both in storage and during transfer. Ensures data remains confidential and intact.</br>
5. <b>Endpoint Security: </b> Secures devices like computers and smartphones that connect to networks. Acts as a guard for each device.</br>
6. <b>Mobile Security:</b> Focuses on protecting smartphones and tablets from threats like malicious apps and unsecured Wi-Fi.</br>
7. <b>Identity and Access M anagement:</b> Ensures only authorised people can access specific resources. Controls who can see or use certain data or systems.</br>
8. <b>Internet of Things Security:</b> Protects connected devices like smart home appliances. Addresses the unique challenges of securing numerous interconnected devices.</br>
9. <b>Data Security:</b> Protects data throughout its lifecycle using encryption and access controls.</br>
10.<b>Operational Security:</b> Involves strategies and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. Creates overall plans for data protection.</P>
<h1>Why AI is Critical in Cyber Security</h1>
For the enterprise, fending off cyberattacks is growing more complex as the threat landscape expands,data proliferates and the volume and sophisticationof attacks increase.​​</p>
<h1>Key princeples of cyber security</h1>
<p> today’s world, the realm of cyber security plays a pivotal role in safeguarding our digital assets. Here are the key principles of cyber security.</br></br>
<b>1. Risk Management:</b> Recognizing, evaluating, and organizing hazards in order to apply suitable steps that decrease their possible consequences.</br>
<b>2. Network Security:</b> Employing safety precautions like firewalls and systems for detecting intrusions to defend the network structure.</br>
<b>3. Malware Prevention:</b> Utilizing antivirus programs and additional tools to discover, stop, and get rid of harmful software.</br>
<b>4. Secure Configuration:</b> Making certain that systems, applications, and devices have secure configurations to reduce susceptibility.</br>
<b>5. Security Beyond Firewall:</b> Introducing more protective layers, such as encryption and two-factor authentication, for added protection of sensitive data.</br>
<b>6. User Education and Awareness:</b> Offering education and resources to assist users in comprehending online dangers and adopting secure internet habits.</p>
